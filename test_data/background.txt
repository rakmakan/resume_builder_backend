Employment history Linkedin

- Behavox | LLM / Generative AI / ML Engineer | Montréal, QC, Canada
    Jan 2023 - Present
    Project Pathfinder
    - Collaborated with the R&D team to develop an AI platform powered by large language models (LLMs) tailored for the finance compliance domain.
    - LLM Pretraining: Pretrained LLMs on proprietary financial chat datasets using Masked Language Modeling on 2B tokens, optimized for multi-GPU (H100) environments with Python's Pytorch, transformers and Accelerate module.
    - Text Summarization Tool: Built a text summarization tool within the AI platform by implementing prompt-based instruction fine-tuning on SME-curated datasets using ALPACA format
    - Established a data framework for version-controlled perturbed datasets, enabling augmented training and validation during fine-tuning.
    Continuous Training Pipeline:
    - Designed and automated a training pipeline for logistic regression, BERT-family models, ONNX-format models, and LLM-based text classification.
    - Reduced manual release efforts by 90% by automating training, validation, and deployment processes.
    - Integrated checkpoint selection for a multilingual, multi-class DeBERTa classification model, leveraging a custom scoring method across languages for optimal performance.
    Advanced Scenarios: Custom Fraud Detection Solution:
    - Led requirement gathering, ideation, and deployment of a hybrid fraud detection solution combining keyword-based and machine-learning models.
    - Developed a multilingual keyword extraction tool using the KeyBERT framework and a custom SBERT model.
    - Successfully deployed the solution, resulting in a $500K revenue boost within a single quarter and serving as a gateway to the Behavox compliance solution suite.

Projects:
- Project: RAG implementation with Phi-3.5B:
    ● Designed and developed a pipeline for context retrieval and interactive querying using a custom LLM (Phi-ONNX) and HuggingFace embeddings. Built and stored a vector-based index from PDF documents for efficient retrieval.
    ● Utilized HuggingFace's embedding models and Microsoft Phi-ONNX to generate contextual responses. Designed an interactive querying interface with similarity postprocessing and dynamic prompt generation for accurate response synthesis.

- LLM Model Interfaces
    ● This project is a Python application designed for machine learning model training and inference. It leverages models in both Hugging Face and ONNX formats, enabling efficient training and inference processes. The application is modular, with each Python file serving a specific purpose.

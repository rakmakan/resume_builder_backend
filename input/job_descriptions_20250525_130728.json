With Blueprint, therapists aren't just managing their work; they're supported by tools that understand the context of each client interaction. Compared to legacy software tools, Blueprint feels more like having the world's best executive assistant at your side.Today, over 50,000 therapists are on Blueprint, leveraging our platform to enhance care for hundreds of thousands of clients. We've found strong product-market fit and are scaling rapidly to meet demand.Our organization is very flat and our team is intentionally small and talent-dense. We like people who are truthseekers, creative, and passionate about improving mental health care.We're a remote-first company (US and Canada only, for now) and come together in person a few times a year to connect, have fun, and help shape the future of mental health care.About The RoleWe're looking for an experienced AI/ML Engineer to take ownership of evaluation and quality across our AI systems. At Blueprint, AI isn't a bolt-on \u2014 it's the foundation of our product. We use LLMs to automate clinical documentation, deliver clinical insights, and reimagine how therapists work.This role is about making sure those systems work reliably, safely, and well. You'll design the evaluation infrastructure that helps us measure what \"good\" looks like across subjective, human-centered workflows and build the tools to track, test, and improve model outputs over time.You'll work closely with engineering, product, and clinical leaders to define quality in practical, therapist-facing terms and make sure we have the systems in place to deliver it consistently.This is a highly cross-functional, high-impact role. Your work will directly shape what tens of thousands of therapists experience when they use our product every day.What You'll DoDesign and build our end-to-end evaluation infrastructure: LLM-as-a-judge, human QA pipelines, offline scoring, and moreDefine and implement application-specific quality metrics \u2014 not just accuracy, but tone, structure, clinical alignment, and moreCollaborate with product and clinical leads to turn subjective requirements into structured evaluation criteriaMonitor and analyze model performance across different therapist cohorts and workflowsBuild tools and processes to capture in-the-wild feedback from clinicians and route it back into model and product improvement loopsWork closely with engineers to integrate eval into our CI, deployment, and iteration cyclesHelp shape data labeling, prompt evaluation, experiment design, and prompt tuning frameworksWho We're Looking ForYou're a hands-on ML/AI practitioner who's passionate about building high-quality systems that actually get used \u2014 not just optimizing for benchmark scores. You've worked with LLMs in production at scale and know the hard part is making outputs reliable, human-aligned, and easy to evaluate. You're motivated by impact, comfortable with ambiguity, and thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments.You might be a fit if:You've built or owned evaluation infrastructure for LLMs or generative AI productsYou have experience designing QA workflows, human-in-the-loop systems, or LLM-as-a-judge pipelinesYou think in terms of feedback loops \u2014 and can turn fuzzy product goals into testable quality metricsYou write code, ship experiments, and are comfortable working across the stack to get the right signals flowingYou're excited about working closely with product, design, and domain experts to define and refine what \"good\" means in a real-world AI applicationBonus if you have:Experience in healthcare, mental health, or other high-trust environmentsFamiliarity with labeling, data QA, or prompt engineering at scaleA strong POV on eval tools, metrics, or best practices \u2014 and a willingness to invent new ones where neededBenefitsCompetitive salary and equity100% remote - no office, no commutingHealth, dental, and vision insurance, with 75% of your premium covered by BlueprintSemi-annual team gatherings (in Chicago!)Unlimited PTOOpportunities to grow with the company and shape our productHardworking, mission-driven, friendly coworkersBlueprint is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or related condition, or any other basis protected by law.\n        \n\n\n        \n            Show more\n          \n\n          \n\n\n\n        \n            Show less",
